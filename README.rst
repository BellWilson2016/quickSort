quickSort
=========

MATLAB code for spike sorting extracellular recordings of Drosophila ORNs. 

There's a lot of messy code here. Some of it also requires t-SNE: http://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne to work well. There are two sorts of things in here: command-line tools for semi-automated spike detection, and a GUI for review and editing of cluster assignments.

If you're exploring, for command-line tools start with: fullSort.m

For the GUI, start with handSort.m
